## Backstory

I first heared of the science fair, or more formaly known as ICEF, in later half of my sophmore year of high school.
Unfortunatly, the due date to sign up for sefh, my regional division of ISEF, was too late. Nevertheless, I still thought it would be pretty cool to make something for the upcomming year that would also challenge me.

Replace the `public/images/avatar.jpg` file with your own avatar image. It is used on the `/about` page as well as on the dynamically generated `open-graph` images.

<SmartImage
  src="/images/projects/project-01/cover-01.jpg"
  sizes="640px"
  alt="Example image"
  aspectRatio="16/9"
  radius="l"
/>

## The AD-1 FPV Idea

My friend at the time became obsessed with NASA's <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/reference/ad-1/">Ames-Dryden AD-1</a> project and really wanted to work with me on it. More colloquially known as the oblique wing plane, the project
was a very interesting first project for the science fair. While it was not an original idea, it could have many applications in the real world as a theoretically more efficient substitute for drones
or even a more efficient substitute for conventional military FPVs, especially with the war in Ukraine being a hot topic.

Replace the `src/app/favicon.ico` file with your own favicon.


Replace the content in the `resources/content.js` file with your own content. You can use custom components in most cases, since the props are usually declared as `ReactNode` instead of `string`, but it's important that you need to import them in the file.

## The Urgent Change of Plans

## Air Purifier on a Budget (Money and Time)

## The Final Date

## What I learned
<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    highlight="1-2"
    codeInstances={[
  {
    code:
`import { InlineCode } from "@/once-ui/components";
import Link from "next/link";

const person = {
  ...
};`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: "src/app/resources/content.js"
  }
]} />

The imports above would let us use `InlineCode` and `Link` components in the content file.

### Personal details

Your personal details are used across the whole app to render personalized headings, labels and images. Languages are displayed on the `/about` page, and location and time in the header.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    highlight="2-3,7-10"
    codeInstances={[
  {
    code:
`const person = {
    firstName: "Selene",
    lastName: "Yu",
    get name() {
      return "...";
    },
    role: "Design Engineer",
    avatar: "/images/avatar.jpg",
    location: "Asia/Jakarta", // Expecting the IANA time zone identifier, e.g., 'Europe/Vienna'
    languages: ["English", "Bahasa"], // optional: Leave the array empty if you don't want to display languages
};`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: "src/app/resources/content.js"
  }
]} />

### Social links

Social links are rendered on the `/about` page and in the footer based on the array configured in the `social` object. You can set custom icons to each, but don't forget to import them in `src/once-ui/icons.ts`. Read the Once UI documentation](https://once-ui.com/docs/icons) for more information.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    codeInstances={[
  {
    code:
`const social = [
    {
      name: "GitHub",
      icon: "github",
      link: "https://github.com/once-ui-system/nextjs-starter",
    },
    {
      name: "Email",
      icon: "email",
      link: "mailto:lorant@once-ui.com",
    },
];`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: "src/app/resources/content.js"
  }
]} />

### Pages

Each page have it's own object that manages the personalized content, such as headings, subheadings, images and dynamic data.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    codeInstances={[
  {
    code:
`const home = {
    label: "Home",
    title: "Selene Yu's Portfolio",
    description: "Portfolio website showcasing my work as a Design Engineer",
    headline: <>Design engineer and builder</>,
    subline: (
      <>
        I'm Selene, a design engineer at <InlineCode>FLY</InlineCode>, where I craft intuitive
        <br /> user experiences. After hours, I build my own projects.
      </>
    ),
};`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: "src/app/resources/content.js"
  }
]} />

The `label` property is used in the header navigation. The `title` property is used for the page title and the `description` property is used for the page description. They are also used in meta- and open graph tags.
