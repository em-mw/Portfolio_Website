# THIS POST IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

## My Experience

Today marks the last day at Texas Childrens Hospital this year. I had a great time working at Texas Childrens Hospital this summer working as a researcher in the Translational Imaging Group (TIGr). The people there were amazing to work with, not only being kind but also going out of their way to help me whenever I needed it.

It suprised me how much work goes into research. While being in an intern position, I did not have nearly the amount of work to do as the professors did. They told me that it is not uncommon for them to work late hours sometimes even until 4am when they have a grant due.

For all of the researchers out there, I tip my hat to you.


# What I Did

Unfortunatly, **I cannot disclose everything I did**. Some of the projects that I was part of are still in development and are in the process of being tested, patented, and published

**Here is what I can show you though:**

## 3D Printing Vascular Structures

## Dip Coating Machine

While being there, I also made a dip coating machine
