## The Goal

Create a air purifier that could be easily implemented in lower income areas, especially ones with bad air quality.

# Technical Overview

## Key Components

- **Raspberry Pi Pico**: [RP2040](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RP2040) micro controller that supports various `Python` flavors as well as `C`. This is what is responsible for making the purifier automated.
- **SPG30 TOVC Sensor**: [I²C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C) sensor that allows easy communication to the Raspberry Pi Pico, giving a fairly accurate reading of the [TOVC]() in its surrounding area.
- **1602 16x2 LCD Display**: [I²C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C) display that provides the basic functionality for reading output data from the `SPG30 TOVC` sensor.
- **HEPA Filter**: Filter that filters through fine particulate matter.
- **Activated Charcoal Filter**: Porous filter that absorbs many chemicals, ordors, and organic compounds

# Story Behind The Project

## Backstory

I first heared of the science fair, or more formaly known as [ICEF](), in later half of my sophmore year of high school.
Unfortunatly, the due date to sign up for [sefh](), my regional division of ISEF, was too late. Nevertheless, I still thought it would be pretty cool to make something for the upcomming year that would also challenge me.

One of my classmates became obsessed with NASA's <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/reference/ad-1/">Ames-Dryden AD-1</a> project and really wanted to work with me on it. More colloquially known as the oblique wing plane, the project
was a very interesting first project for the science fair. While it was not an original idea, it could have many applications in the real world as a theoretically more efficient substitute for drones
or even a more efficient substitute for conventional military FPVs, especially with the war in Ukraine being a hot topic.

Replace the content in the `resources/content.js` file with your own content. You can use custom components in most cases, since the props are usually declared as `ReactNode` instead of `string`, but it's important that you need to import them in the file.

## The Urgent Change of Plans

Unfortunatly due to my clasmate's erratic nature, he ended up using one of his other projects that he was developing. This meant that **I only had 1 week** to come up with an idea and to execute it.

With this unfortunate news, I immediately remembered my previous preliminary research that I had done regarding air purifiers, due to my alergies, and I reaslized how expensive they all are. When I got one myself [(this one in particular)](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/foernuftig-air-purifier-white-50461961/) I remember laughing at how much a plastic housing with a fan could cost and I immediately knew this was a good project to pursue

Balancing my workload between this project and school was hard, especially since this project was meant to be worked on over a much longer timespan than just 1 week, but I managed to do it somehow with a pretty decent result. Unfortunatly I did not have a working model due to the fact that the

Unfortunatly no, but this was expected. Only spending a week on developing a "fully functional" model the main point to its poor performance at the science fair. However, this does not mean that all hope is lost.

## What I learned

I learned a lot through this event. Of course it exposed me to how fun hardware development can be and how [I²C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C) even function, but, more importantly, I learned that you must chose the people that you work with wisely. My clasmate ditching me made me realise how dependent each person is for achieving a final product; chosing a weak group member will only make things harder than they need to be.

I am glad that I realised this so early on in my life as the outcome could have been far worse for me.

## Outcome

Even though this project was not the sucess that I hoped that it would be, I am still pretty happy with what I achieved, especially while balancing my school workload with this work intensive project.
